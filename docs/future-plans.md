  - Create embeddable widgets for websites and dashboards

### 2. Advanced Technologies

- **Serverless Architecture**
  - Migrate components to serverless functions for better scaling
  - Implement edge computing for faster global response
  - Optimize for cost-efficiency with pay-per-use model

- **Blockchain Integration**
  - Explore decentralized availability tracking
  - Implement token-based incentives for accurate information
  - Develop smart contracts for automated purchasing workflows

- **AI Assistant Integration**
  - Create voice-activated interfaces for popular assistants
  - Implement conversational interfaces for configuration
  - Develop predictive recommendations based on user preferences

## Implementation Prioritization

When implementing these future plans, priorities should be determined based on:

1. **User Impact**: Features that directly enhance end-user experience
2. **Stability**: Improvements that increase application reliability
3. **Performance**: Optimizations that reduce resource usage or improve speed
4. **Extensibility**: Changes that make future development easier
5. **Innovation**: Novel features that differentiate from alternatives

The Streetmerchant team should regularly review and adjust these priorities based on user feedback, emerging technologies, and changing market conditions.
