# Deduplication Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've created several prototype implementations to address the code duplication identified in the `streetmerchant` project. These implementations follow a more object-oriented and data-driven approach to significantly reduce both code duplication and the overall file count.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Store Registry

**File:** `/src/store/model/store-registry.ts`

This implementation:
- Creates a single central registry for all store configurations
- Replaces 100+ individual store files with a single data structure
- Adds type safety through TypeScript interfaces
- Provides helper functions to create stores with proper configuration
- Simplifies adding new stores by just adding a new entry to the registry
- Makes it easier to apply consistent changes across all stores

### 2. Series Data Organization

**File:** `/src/store/model/series-data.ts`

This implementation:
- Replaces hundreds of tiny series-specific files with a JSON-like data structure
- Organizes product links by series and store in a more maintainable format
- Provides helper functions to filter and retrieve links as needed
- Makes it easy to add or update product links programmatically
- Reduces the total number of files by an order of magnitude
- Makes it much faster to search for specific products across stores

### 3. Browser Session Management

**File:** `/src/browser/browser-session.ts`

This implementation:
- Creates a unified class-based approach to browser management
- Consolidates various browser functions into a cohesive API
- Improves error handling and resource management
- Makes it easier to track and manage browser instances
- Centralizes browser configuration logic
- Provides clear abstraction layers for browser operations

### 4. Request Handling

**File:** `/src/network/request-handler.ts`

This implementation:
- Creates a unified class for handling HTTP requests and responses
- Consolidates retry and backoff logic
- Standardizes captcha detection and handling
- Centralizes stock checking logic
- Improves error reporting and logging
- Makes the code more testable by encapsulating state

## Migration Strategy

To implement these changes with minimal disruption:

1. Start with the Store Registry:
   - First implement alongside existing files
   - Gradually migrate stores to use the registry
   - Remove individual store files once migrated

2. Then implement the Series Data organization:
   - Create the central data structure
   - Migrate product links from individual files
   - Update the store setup logic to use the new approach

3. Implement the Browser Session class:
   - Create the new class with all functionality
   - Update the codebase to use the new class
   - Phase out the old functions

4. Finally, implement the Request Handler:
   - Create the new class alongside existing code
   - Gradually refactor the lookup logic to use it
   - Remove duplicated logic once migration is complete

## Benefits

These implementations will provide significant benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Vastly improved code organization and reduced duplication
2. **Scalability**: Easier to add new stores, product series, and functionality
3. **Reliability**: Consistent patterns lead to fewer bugs and edge cases
4. **Performance**: Potential improvements by reducing redundant operations
5. **Developer Experience**: Easier onboarding and faster iterations

## Next Steps

After implementing these core changes:

1. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
2. Write comprehensive tests for the new components
3. Consider further refactoring for other duplicated areas
4. Update the build and deployment processes if needed

These changes maintain compatibility with the existing functionality while significantly improving the code structure.
