# Store Registry Migration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `src/store/model/index.ts`**
   - Modified to use the modular registry pattern
   - Simplified store loading to use only the registry
   - Removed legacy file-based store loading mechanism

2. **Updated Store Registry Files**
   - Enhanced store configurations in region-specific registry files (us-stores.ts, eu-stores.ts, etc.)
   - Updated store labels with accurate selectors from the original implementations
   - Added proper country and currency information

3. **Updated `src/store/model/store-registry.ts`**
   - Ensured it properly re-exports from registry module

4. **Created Helper Scripts**
   - Added `cleanup-stores.sh` to remove unused files
   - Created `update-registry.sh` to complete the migration process
   - Scripts automate cleanup and validation of the migration

## Registry Pattern Implementation

The registry pattern offers several benefits:
- Centralized store configuration
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better organization by region/country
- More robust store creation through factory functions

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Cleanup Script**
   ```
   ./cleanup-stores.sh
   ```

2. **Consider Additional Improvements**
   - Enhance store categorization by adding more specific metadata
   - Add more detailed labels for each store type
   - Create helper functions for adding new stores to specific regions

3. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new registry pattern
   - Create examples for adding new stores to the registry

## Testing

Before deploying to production, verify:
1. All stores load properly
2. Stock checks work as expected
3. No regressions in notification functionality

The application has been successfully compiled with the new changes.
