# Migration Notes

## Registry Pattern Migration Observations

During the migration to the registry pattern, we observed:

1. Most store files had already been updated to use `createStoreFromRegistry`
2. The core functionality for store creation was already established in factory functions
3. The application had a working loader for registry-based stores

## Benefits Realized

- **Simplified Store Management**: All store configurations are now in region-specific files
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Adding a new store requires updating only one registry file
- **Better Organization**: Stores are grouped by region/country
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common store configurations are shared

## Lessons Learned

1. **Strategic Migration**: The approach of migrating one store at a time worked well
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining a compatibility layer during migration helped prevent regressions
3. **Code Cleanup**: Identifying and removing unused code was an essential step

## Recommendations for Future Migrations

1. **Examine Backup Files**: Ensure all data from backup files is properly migrated before removal
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each regional registry file before proceeding
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as you go rather than at the end

These notes should help with future refactoring efforts in the codebase.
